Creating a many to many project for Maddie

 So it's your first day on the job at yelp and they are having a major issues managing the reviews for each customer. They need a way to manage the reviews given by certain customers about certain restauruants.  Yelp is asking for you to create a tracker for all the reviews.
 
 Each review  needs a Rating and Content, each restuaruant needs a Name and a Location and each customer needs a name. Well now since we're keeping track of everything, Everytime a review is created, it needs to have the corresponding customer and restaurant displayed.  Now remember, A Customer can have many Reviews, also a restaurant can have many reviews. I wonder what's the relationship between Customer and Restaurant. Hmm.
 
 
1. Create a Customer#index page that displays each Customers name, a link to their show page, and a count of how many Restaurants they have been to.

2.Create a Customer#show page that displays the customer name, with each Review's Content, rating, and Restaurant name (linking to the Restaurant's show page).

3.Create a Restaurant#index page that displays a link to each Restaurants show page and the total number of Review's they have.

4.Create a Restaurant#show page that lists the name and location for each of their Reviews and links to the corresponding Customer show page.

5.Create a Review#index page that shows all the reviews.

6.Create a new Review that gives you a list of all the restuarants, and your are able to type in a Customer's name.(Make sure that the customer name field isn't blank , and that the content is no longer than 500 words and the review is between 1-5)

7. Able to edit a review's content and rating.

8. Able to delete a review when needed.
